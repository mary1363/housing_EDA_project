# Real Estate EDA and Cleaning Project

This repository contains the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on a real estate dataset. The work was done in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.  

## Contents
- raw_house_data.csv – Original dataset.  
- cleaned_houses_dataset.csv – Cleaned dataset ready for modeling.  
- cleaned_houses_dataset.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with full EDA and data cleaning steps.  
- cleaned_houses_dataset.html – HTML export of the notebook with all plots and outputs.  

## Project Summary
- Handled missing values using median/mode imputation.  
- Applied log transformation to skewed numeric features.  
- Visualized distributions with histograms and boxplots.  
- Checked correlations and identified potential multicollinearity.  
- Explored categorical features using frequency counts.  
- Prepared a clean dataset for modeling purposes.  

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) to see the analysis and visualizations.  
2. Use cleaned_houses_data.csv as input for modeling or further analysis.
